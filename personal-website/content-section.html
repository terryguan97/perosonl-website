                        <h1> Portfolio Website </h1>
                        <p>  This website was my first project for my web design class in my junior year of university. It was my first introduction to HTML, CSS, PHP, and WordPress. The purpose of this project was to create a webpage that was dynamic,  which the contents could be changed by anyone with ease, and responsive, where the website's layout adapts to the size of the viewport. Although it is a bit rough around the edges, this is a project I am incredibly fond of and still update to this day. </p>

                        <h1> Personally Designed And Customized </h1>
                        <p> When I try to create anything, I try to do everything from scratch in order to understand the entire process. Of course, this doesn't mean I didn't use any references. No template was used for this website. It was coded from scatched with designed with a black and white minimalist approach in mind. The only colors used are black, white, grey, and goldenrod for headings and emphasis. </p>

                        <p> One big thing I used for version control was Pantheon.IO, a WebOps platform that acts as a repository whenever I made changes to my custom theme. I would use an SFTP client to push changes and upload files. </p>

                        <h1> JavaScript Libraries </h1>
                            <p>JavaScript was optional for the project, as the course was geared towards beginners who were taught the basics of HTML and CSS. However, I was taking a programming graphics class in the same semester and was learning JavaScript, specifically JCanvas, a JS library that made HTML5 Canvas easier to work with. I combined what I learned in both courses to put together the animated graphic on my home page. The site also uses JQuery and AOS for other site animations. </p>
